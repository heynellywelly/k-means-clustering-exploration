# machine-learning-techniques-exploration

## Description
A repository of simple experiments to explore various Machine Learning techniques, in the context of some data sets. Not every experiment involves writing the algorithms from scratch, nor will every experiment be a complicated spangle of advanced techniques. The idea of this repository is for my personal development and exploration, and is by no means a "must-follow" guide.
